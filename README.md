CLIP Image Analysis with OpenCV
===============================

Overview
--------

This project demonstrates how to use OpenAI's CLIP model for analyzing images with textual descriptions using OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to showcase how multimodal models like CLIP can be applied to tasks that require both image and text understanding.

Features
--------

*   Load and preprocess images using OpenCV.
    
*   Use the CLIP model to encode and analyze images.
    
*   Perform image-text matching to find the best description for an image.
    
*   Display the image directly in the notebook using cv2\_imshow.
    

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Python 3.x
    
*   OpenAI CLIP model
    
*   OpenCV
    
*   PyTorch
